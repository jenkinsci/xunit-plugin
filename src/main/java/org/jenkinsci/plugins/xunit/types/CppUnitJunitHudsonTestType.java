/**
 * <a href="http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/doc/cvs/index.html">CppUnit</a> is a
 * unit testing framework module for the C++ programming language.
 * <p>
 * The first port of JUnit to C++ was done by Michael Feathers. His versions can
 * be found on the XProgramming software page. They are os-specific, so Jerome
 * Lacoste provided a port to Unix/Solaris. His version can be found on the same
 * page. The CppUnit project has combined and built on this work.
